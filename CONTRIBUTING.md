# Contributing

The following are some guidelines to follow when contributing.

## Commit messages

Commit messages start with a captial letter. The first word should be a verb to represent what the main intention is. For example, a commit intended to fix a bug would have a message that goes something like `Fix major bug in core`. Other verbs include `Create`, `Add`, `Refactor`, `Change`, `Remove` and `Delete`.

## Branching

Branch names start with verbs to represent what the main intention is. For example, a branch intended to add a new feature would be `create-new-feature`. Other verbs include `add`, `refactor`, `change`, `fix`, `remove` and `delete`.

Additionally, if the branch only concerns a single package, the branch name should be preceded with the package that the branch is intended for. For example, branches that work on the `api` package should be named `api/branch-name`. For branches that concern the repository in general, the branch name should remain as is.
